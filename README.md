## Dependencies

- **Bootstrap**. Froala Design Blocks is built on Bootstrap 4 library and fully supports it. It uses the Javascript files only for the header design blocks, so if you don't need them, we recommend not to include the Bootstrap JS files in order to reduce your bundle size.

- **Font Awesome**. We're using the amazing Font Awesome library for the social network icons.

- **Google Fonts**. By default, the Design Blocks toolkit is built using the Roboto font, however that can easily be changed to other fonts.
