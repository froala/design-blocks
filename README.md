## Quick start

There are several ways to start using the Froala Design Blocks:

- [Use the builder](https://www.froala.com/design-blocks/webpage-builder)
- [Download the latest release](https://github.com/froala/design-blocks/archive/1.0.2.zip) and then read the [What's included](#whats-included) section below
- Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/froala/design-blocks.git`
- Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): `npm install froala-design-blocks`

### Development

The project needs to be compiled, therefore the files in the `src` folder are those we'll be developing on. Don't make changes in the `dist` or `demo` folders as they will be overwritten when `src` is compiled.

#### Get code

```bash
git clone git@github.com:froala/design-blocks.git
cd design-blocks
```

#### Install dependencies and run project

```bash
npm install
npm run gulp
```

With the gulp server running, the project is available at the following address [localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001/). The `src` files are automatically compiled when changes have been made.

### Contributing
All contributions are more than welcomed. Contributions may close an issue, fix a bug (reported or not reported), add new design blocks, improve the existing code, add new feature, and so on.

The `dev` branch is the default and base branch for the project. It is used for development and all Pull Requests should go there. Please make sure not to commit the `dist` folder in the `dev` branch.

## Bugs and feature requests

Have a bug or a feature request? Please first read the issue guidelines and search for existing and closed issues. If your problem or idea is not addressed yet, [please open a new issue](https://github.com/froala/design-blocks/issues/new).

## Dependencies

- **Bootstrap**. Froala Design Blocks is built on Bootstrap 4 library and fully supports it. It uses the Javascript files only for the header design blocks, so if you don't need them, we recommend not to include the Bootstrap JS files in order to reduce your bundle size.

- **Font Awesome**. We're using the amazing Font Awesome library for the social network icons.

- **Google Fonts**. By default, the Design Blocks toolkit is built using the Roboto font, however that can easily be changed to other fonts.
